## 🚀 How to Get Started

Ready to get yelled at... I mean, *coached*... by an AI? Here's how to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   **Node.js & npm:** Make sure you have them installed. [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **MongoDB:** You'll need a running instance of MongoDB. You can use a local installation or a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
*   **Git:** Because, obviously.

### 2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash

    cd DIET_PLANNER
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create your Environment File:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following variables. This is your secret sauce! 🤫

    ```env
